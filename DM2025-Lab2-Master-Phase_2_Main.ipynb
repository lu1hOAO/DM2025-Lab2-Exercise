       "*   **Positional Encoding:**  Crucially, the Transformer *doesn't* directly use positional embeddings like BERT. Instead, it employs **positional encoding**. This is a separate vector added to the word embedding to encode the position of each word in the sequence.  The original paper used a specific sinusoidal function to generate these positional encodings:\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   `PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))`\n",

       "**BERT Input Embedding:**\n",

Instead of representing entire words, it breaks words down into subword units (e.g., \"playing\" might be split into \"play\" and \"##ing\"). This allows BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary words (words not seen during training) and to be more efficient in representing rare words.\n",
       "*   **Positional Embeddings:** BERT *does* use learned positional embeddings. These are separate, learned vectors associated with each position in the input sequence.  The model learns these embeddings during training.\n",

This is particularly important for tasks like question answering or next sentence prediction, where the model needs to understand the relationship between two sentences.  For example, the first sentence might have a segment embedding of \"A\" and the second sentence might have a segment embedding of \"B\".\n",
       "*   **Special Tokens:** BERT uses special tokens like:\n",
       "    *   `[CLS]` (Classification) - Added at the beginning of the input sequence.  The output embedding of this token is often used for classification tasks.\n",

      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",

    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",

And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "### Compare and discuss the overall results of the zero-shot, 1-shot and 5-shot classification.\n",
    "1. **整體表現比較**  \n",
    "  Zero-shot 的整體準確率約 **52.5%**，明顯低於 1-shot 的 **61.25%** 以及 5-shot 的 **60%**。在沒有example 的情況下，模型較難精準掌握四種情緒的分類方式；而加入示範後，模型能更好的掌握資訊\n",
    "2. **1-shot 的表現提升最明顯**  \n",
    "  1-shot 在 precision、recall、F1-score 上幾乎都比 zero-shot 好。尤其是 joy 與 sadness 的 recall 顯著上升，使整體準確率提升近 9%。而且在 1-shot 表現中，各情緒的 precision 也較平均，顯示模型沒有只學會其中一種情緒。雖然 5-shot 的表現（60%）略高於 zero-shot，但卻沒有超越 1-shot。部分情緒如 joy 的結果與 1-shot 相近，表示在這個任務中提供更多示範並不一定帶來更好的表現，可能因為示範的格式相似、資訊同質性高，使模型獲得的額外訊息有限。\n",
    "3. **情緒分類細節**  \n",
    "  Zero-shot 中 fear 的 recall 表現很低（0.30），代表模型不太了解這種情緒對應到的詞彙有哪些；加入示範後，fear 的 recall 在 1-shot 與 5-shot 均提升至 0.50，表示 example 確實給模型額外的資訊，讓模型更有效的捕捉語意\n",
    "    另外，在三種設定（zero-shot、1-shot、5-shot）中，**joy 的 precision 都比 recall 低**，這代表模型在判斷 joy 時，**容易把其他情緒錯誤歸類成 joy**。推測是因為joy 的用詞較廣泛多樣，邊界不明確，模型容易把帶有正面語氣或較溫和的敘述都歸入 joy。"

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
