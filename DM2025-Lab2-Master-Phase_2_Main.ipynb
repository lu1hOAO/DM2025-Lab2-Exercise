       "The input embedding mechanisms of the original Transformer and BERT differ in several key aspects, primarily in how they handle positional information and the nature of the input they process. Here's a breakdown:\n",

       "**Original Transformer Input Embedding:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Word Embeddings:** The original Transformer uses learned word embeddings to represent each word in the input sequence. These embeddings capture semantic information about the words.\n",
       "*   **Positional Encoding:**  Crucially, the Transformer *doesn't* directly use positional embeddings like BERT. Instead, it employs **positional encoding**. This is a separate vector added to the word embedding to encode the position of each word in the sequence.  The original paper used a specific sinusoidal function to generate these positional encodings:\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   `PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))`\n",
       "    *   `PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))`\n",
       "\n",
       "    Where:\n",
       "    *   `pos` is the position of the word in the sequence.\n",
       "    *   `i` is the dimension index of the embedding vector.\n",
       "    *   `d_model` is the dimensionality of the embedding vectors (e.g., 512).\n",
       "\n",
       "    This sinusoidal approach allows the model to learn relative positions and generalize to sequence lengths longer than those seen during training.\n",

       "\n",
       "**BERT Input Embedding:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **WordPiece Embeddings:** BERT uses WordPiece embeddings.  WordPiece is a subword tokenization technique.  Instead of representing entire words, it breaks words down into subword units (e.g., \"playing\" might be split into \"play\" and \"##ing\"). This allows BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary words (words not seen during training) and to be more efficient in representing rare words.\n",
       "*   **Positional Embeddings:** BERT *does* use learned positional embeddings. These are separate, learned vectors associated with each position in the input sequence.  The model learns these embeddings during training.\n",
       "*   **Segment Embeddings:** BERT also incorporates segment embeddings.  These embeddings are used to distinguish between different segments of text in the input. This is particularly important for tasks like question answering or next sentence prediction, where the model needs to understand the relationship between two sentences.  For example, the first sentence might have a segment embedding of \"A\" and the second sentence might have a segment embedding of \"B\".\n",
       "*   **Special Tokens:** BERT uses special tokens like:\n",
       "    *   `[CLS]` (Classification) - Added at the beginning of the input sequence.  The output embedding of this token is often used for classification tasks.\n",
       "    *   `[SEP]` (Separator) - Used to separate different segments of text (e.g., sentences).\n",

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we define this schema using Python classes. Think of each class as defining a JSON object:\n",
    "*   The **attributes** of the class (e.g., `topic_name`, `sub_title`) become the keys in the final JSON object.\n",
    "*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even nest these classes inside one another to create complex, hierarchical JSON structures. This allows us to precisely control the format of the output, transforming the LLM from a simple text generator into a reliable tool for automated and structured data extraction.\n",

       "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
